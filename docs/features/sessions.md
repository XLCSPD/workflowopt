# Waste Walk Sessions Guide

Learn how to create, run, and manage waste walk sessions.

## Overview

Waste walk sessions are collaborative activities where team members observe a process and identify waste. ProcessOpt facilitates these sessions digitally, allowing:

- Real-time collaboration
- Structured observation tagging
- Automatic data aggregation
- Immediate analytics

Draft → Active → Completed → Archived
```

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Draft** | Created but not started |
| **Active** | In progress, accepting observations |
| **Completed** | Finished, results available |
| **Archived** | Stored for historical reference |

2. Find the active session
3. Click **"Join Session"**
4. You'll see the workflow with observation tools

### Ending a Session

1. Open the active session
2. Click the **three-dot menu** (⋮) or **"End Session"**
3. Confirm you want to end
4. Session moves to **Completed**
5. No new observations can be added

### Archiving a Session

## The Session Interface

When you join an active session, you'll see:

### Workflow View
- Visual representation of the process
- Click any step to view or add observations
- Steps with observations are highlighted

### Observation Panel
Opens when you click a step:
- Existing observations for this step
- Form to add new observations

### Session Info
- Session name and status
- Participant count
- Total observations

---

## Adding Observations

### Step 1: Select a Process Step
Click on any step in the workflow where you observe waste.

### Step 2: Open the Observation Form
- Click **"Add Observation"** button
- Or click the **+** icon on the step

### Step 3: Tag Waste Types
Select one or more waste types that apply:
- Browse categories (Core Lean, Digital)
- Click to select/deselect
- Multiple selections allowed

### Step 4: Add Details

**Notes** (Required)
Describe what you observed. Be specific:
- What happened?
- When does it occur?
- Who is affected?

**Digital/Physical Toggle**
Indicate if the waste is:
- Digital (systems, software, data)
- Physical (materials, movement, equipment)
- Or both

### Step 5: Rate the Waste

**Frequency Score** (1-5)
How often does this occur?
- 1 = Rarely
- 5 = Constantly

**Impact Score** (1-5)
How significant is the effect?
- 1 = Minimal impact
- 5 = Severe impact

**Ease Score** (1-5)
How easy to fix?
- 1 = Very difficult
- 5 = Quick win

### Step 6: Save
Click **"Save Observation"** to record your finding.

## Session Results

After completing a session, the results page shows:

### Summary Statistics
- Total observations count
- Waste type distribution
- Steps with most observations
- Participant contributions

### Observation List
- All observations organized by step
- Filter by waste type
- Sort by priority score

### Charts
- Pie chart of waste type distribution
- Bar chart of observations by lane
- Priority matrix

### Export Options
- **PDF Report** - Formatted document for sharing
- **PowerPoint** - Presentation-ready slides
- **CSV** - Raw data for further analysis

---

## Filtering Sessions

On the Sessions page, filter by status:
- **All Sessions** - Everything
- **Active** - Currently running
- **Draft** - Not yet started
- **Completed** - Finished sessions

---

## Best Practices

### Before the Session
1. **Brief participants** - Explain the process and goals
2. **Review training** - Ensure everyone knows waste types
3. **Share the cheat sheet** - Quick reference during session
4. **Test the workflow** - Verify all steps are correct

### During the Session
1. **Observe, don't fix** - Focus on identifying, not solving
2. **Be specific** - Detailed notes help later analysis
3. **No blame** - Focus on process, not people
4. **Capture everything** - Even small wastes add up

### After the Session
1. **Review together** - Discuss findings as a team
2. **Prioritize** - Use priority scores to rank improvements
3. **Plan actions** - Create improvement initiatives
4. **Share results** - Communicate findings to stakeholders

## Offline Support

If you lose internet connection during a session:
- Observations are saved locally
- They sync automatically when you reconnect
- A notification confirms successful sync

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Cannot add observation"
- Verify the session is still active
- Check your internet connection
- Ensure you're a session participant

### "Session not loading"
- Refresh the page
- Check session status (may have ended)
- Verify you have access

### "Observation not saved"
- Check for validation errors
- Ensure required fields are filled
- Try saving again

# Analytics Dashboard Guide

Learn how to interpret analytics and gain insights from your waste walk data.

## Overview

The Analytics Dashboard transforms your observation data into actionable insights. It provides:

- Visual waste distribution charts
- Hotspot identification
- AI-powered recommendations
- Session comparison tools
- Export capabilities

---

## Accessing Analytics

1. Click **Analytics** in the sidebar
2. View the main dashboard
3. Use the session selector to filter data

---

## Session Selection

At the top of the Analytics page:

- **All Sessions** - Aggregate data from all completed sessions
- **Individual Session** - View data for a specific session

Select from the dropdown to change the view.

---

## Summary Statistics

Four key metrics appear at the top:

### Total Observations
The complete count of waste observations recorded.

### Waste Types Found
Number of different waste categories identified.

### Lanes Affected
How many process swimlanes have waste.

### Quick Wins Available
Opportunities with high impact and low effort.

---

## Waste Type Distribution

### Pie Chart
Shows the percentage breakdown of waste by type.

- Hover over segments for details
- Colors match waste type definitions
- Larger segments indicate more common waste

### How to Interpret
- Dominant waste types need the most attention
- Rare types may still be important if high impact
- Compare to industry benchmarks if available

---

## Observations by Swimlane

### Horizontal Bar Chart
Displays waste counts by process lane.

- Blue bars = Digital waste
- Green bars = Physical waste
- Longer bars = More observations

### How to Interpret
- Lanes with most waste are improvement priorities
- Compare digital vs. physical to guide solutions
- Consider lane complexity when evaluating

---

## Top Waste Hotspots

A ranked list of process steps with the highest priority scores.

### Priority Score Calculation
```
Priority = Frequency × Impact × Ease
```

Higher scores indicate:
- Happens often (Frequency)
- Significant effect (Impact)
- Relatively easy to fix (Ease)

### Hotspot Information
Each hotspot shows:
- **Rank** (1-5)
- **Step Name** - Which process step
- **Lane** - Where in the process
- **Waste Types** - Categories found
- **Priority Score** - Calculated priority
- **Effort Level** - Low, Medium, High

### Taking Action
Focus improvement efforts on:
1. Top-ranked hotspots
2. Low-effort opportunities
3. High-impact quick wins

---

## AI-Generated Insights

The system analyzes your data and generates recommendations:

### Insight Types

| Type | Icon | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| **Quick Win** | ⚡ | Low effort, high impact opportunities |
| **Hotspot** | ⚠️ | Critical areas needing attention |
| **Trend** | 📈 | Patterns in your data |

### Insight Details
Each insight includes:
- Title and description
- Impact level (Low, Medium, High)
- Effort level (Low, Medium, High)
- Recommended actions

### Using Insights
1. Review all generated insights
2. Prioritize quick wins first
3. Plan resources for hotspots
4. Monitor trends over time

---

## Comparing Sessions

### Accessing Comparison
1. Click **"Compare Sessions"** button
2. Or navigate to Analytics → Compare

### Selecting Sessions
1. Choose 2-3 sessions to compare
2. Sessions should be for similar processes
3. Click **"Compare"**

### Comparison View
- Side-by-side waste distribution
- Trend lines showing improvement/regression
- Highlight differences between sessions

### Use Cases
- Before/after improvement initiatives
- Compare different teams or locations
- Track progress over time

---

## Exporting Reports

### PDF Export
1. Click **"Export"** button
2. Select **PDF**
3. Choose sections to include
4. Download the formatted report

### PowerPoint Export
1. Click **"Export"** button
2. Select **PowerPoint**
3. Slides are generated with charts and data
4. Download and customize as needed

### What's Included
- Summary statistics
- Charts and visualizations
- Hotspot rankings
- Insight recommendations
- Observation details

---

## Filtering and Customization

### Time Range
Filter data by when observations were recorded.

### Waste Type Filter
Focus on specific waste categories.

### Lane Filter
View data for specific swimlanes only.

---

## Understanding Charts

### Reading the Pie Chart
- **Segment size** = Percentage of total
- **Hover** = Show exact count and percentage
- **Legend** = Waste type key

### Reading the Bar Chart
- **Bar length** = Observation count
- **Stacked sections** = Digital vs. Physical
- **Lane labels** = Swimlane names

---

## Best Practices

### Regular Review
- Check analytics after each session
- Look for emerging patterns
- Track changes over time

### Share with Stakeholders
- Export reports for management
- Use charts in presentations
- Celebrate improvements

### Take Action
- Don't just analyze, improve
- Assign owners to hotspots
- Set improvement targets
- Measure before and after

### Compare Fairly
- Use similar processes
- Account for session duration
- Consider participant experience

---

## Troubleshooting

### "No data available"
- Complete at least one session first
- Ensure observations were recorded
- Check session selection filter

### "Charts not loading"
- Refresh the page
- Check browser compatibility
- Clear browser cache

### "Insights not generating"
- Need minimum observation count
- Ensure diverse waste types
- Allow processing time for AI analysis

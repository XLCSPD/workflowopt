## Analytics

### Why is my analytics dashboard empty?

Analytics requires completed sessions with observations. If you see no data:
- Complete at least one session
- Ensure observations were recorded

### How are priority scores calculated?

Priority Score = Frequency × Impact × Ease

Higher scores indicate higher priority for improvement.

Yes, but results may be less meaningful. Comparisons work best for:
